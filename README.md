# Multi Oled

This example illustrates how to use the **TCA9548A** multiplexer to drive up to eight **SSD1306** OLED displays on a Raspberry Pi platform (aarch64). Remote development is enabled through the ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh extension, which allows direct access to a bare-metal Raspberry Pi 4. Note that the project employs an older version (14) of clang-format due to PiOS limitations.
